# bff vm
I forgot why I called it bff but let's just say it means ~~"Big fat fuck"~~ "Basic Fast and Furious" virtual machine?

## Details
bff, as of the moment is a 32 bit virtual machine, I could easily make it 64 bit but im just making a prototype, so ill just let it be as of the moment

### RoadMap
- [x] Basic Math Op 
- [x] Basic Control flow
- [x] Basic Bit manipulation
- [x] Call built-in functions, like syscall??
- [x] Proper function argument handling, and storing/loading register state
- [x] 0.1.0
- [x] bffasm works with 0.1.0
- [x] direct string storing
- [ ] call external functions via dll
- [ ] 0.2.0
